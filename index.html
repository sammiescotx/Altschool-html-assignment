        <P>My name is samuel abdullahi a graduate of electrical and electronics engineering currently based in kaduna. i'm a 24 years old aspiring backend developer currently enrolled under the alt school backend engineering program,
             i chose the backend engineering program due to my love for solving technical problems, i joined tech as a front end engineer in the year 2020 but was unable to continue my tech journey due to my academics financial restraint
            , over the years i spent much time researching about tech, reading about the various fields in tech and i discovered i had a deep passion for backend engineering.<br><br>
            I joined Altschool with the goal of becoming a backend engineer, i needed a learning platform were i can get an access to community and not just learning materials, alt school provides that opportunity for me with a good learning environment
            , a simplified way of learning with an amazing tutors, before choosing altschool i did a survey of platforms i can learn coding and the reviews i got about altschool was encouraging and impressive.<br><br>
            My goal for the school of engineering program is to be focused to my goals of joining which is to perfect a coding skill, build relationships, work on projects, i know it's not going to be a smooth journey but with dedication and hardwork
             i believe i can achieve my goals. This has been my dream for a while to learn a tech skill spend much time doing what i love and i'm glad altschool has provided the opportunity for me to be able to achhieve this, 
             i look forward to working alongside with my colleagues builfin projects, doing all my assignment, be dedicated to my learning program. i believe before the end of the program i must have attained all the required skill to be a backend develper.</P><br>
